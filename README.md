# GAOps

Game Asset Operations

- FaceSets to VertexColor from random color.
- Create Stylized Bush.
- Set backface culling for EEVEE's material.
- Batch Export as multiple .glb/.gltf/.fbx files. (I tested only the static model.)
- Launch Substance Painter with selected meshes. (You need to set the path of Substance Painter EXE in preferences.)
